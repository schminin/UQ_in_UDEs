This project investigates different uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for universal differential equations (UQ).
It is structured as follows:

1. experiments
1.1 ensemble
1.2 MCMC
1.3 variational_inference
1.4 new_IC_test
1.5 UMAP
and additional files for the problem definition, simulation and evaluation.
2. Manifest.toml / Project.toml
These documents specify the Julia environment used to execute all experiments.

An overview of the provided code for each of the subexperiments can be found in additional README documents in the respective folders.
Details about the mathematical background and results of the experiments are presented and discussed in the publication "Assessment of Uncertainty Quantification in Universal Differential Equations".
