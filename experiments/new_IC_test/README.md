Based on evaluated experiments for the same problem scenario, this folder contains code to perform a prediction analysis for a new initial condition (IC).

Specifically, there are three files ("ensemble_*", "MCMC_*" and "variational_inference_predictions_for_new_IC.jl") that create the predictions for a new IC based on pre-selected parameter values (i.e. these of the main experiments).
"visualizations.jl" then summarizes the results in the form of a plot.
